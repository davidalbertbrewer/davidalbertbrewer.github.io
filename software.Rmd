This page is under construction....more software projects coming soon!    
  
*Web Applications in Python*  
I have been using Flask to package analytics scripts and dashboards for my current job at [Education Logistics](https://www.edulog.com/)....however I don't have anything which I can make publicly available
  
Here is the framework I started with and built on top of this  
[Flask App](http://davidalbertbrewer.herokuapp.com/)  
  
*Plotly Dash*  
In 2018 I began using Dash by Plotly to productionalize my data analysis work.  I was introduced to this tool by a colleague and instantly realized how powerful this can be to take my scripts and implement them into a resilient web based dashboard.  These interactive charts can handle very robust analysis and user interaction.
  
*Web Scraping*  
I use web scraping tools in various projects  
For real estate related work I have scraped homes for sale, foreclosure lists, Zillow data, etc.  
When API integration is not easily (or cheaply) available I will often use web scraping to get the data from online sources.  This often requires using some basic methods to limit the frequency of hit to a given website or even some basic algorithms to simulate human online interaction with the website.  
      
*Elasticsearch*  
I use Elasticsearch to index large data sets with millions of records.  
Then I use Python scripting to build complex analysis on top of these data.  
For prototyping I setup a local instance in either a Windows or Linux environment.
For production I typically hand off my work to a core engineering team to implement this in a cloud environment.  
Some examples of models put into production using Elasticsearch backend:  
 - Propensity score for online lead generation  
 - Vehicle diagnostics (J1939/OBD) for school district transportation departments with over 15K vehicles    
  
*Reporting Database*  
I can take large structured or unstructured datasets and build reporting database systems.  To do this I create a Python application which interacts with a database backend usually in some flavor of SQL:  SQLite, Postgres, or MySQL.  

*GUI in Python*
I use Tkinter and Kivy to build GUI applications in Python.  Typically these are lightweight programs which can be compiled into a standalone executable for deploying analysis scripts on a server.  
I have also used these packages to build utilities for automating tasks.
