## This page is under construction....
## More software projects coming soon!    
<br>
<br>
  
#### Web Applications in Python  
**Flask is a great way for a data scientist like myself to share my work across an organization.**  
  
I have been using Flask to package analytics scripts and dashboards for my current role at [Education Logistics](https://www.edulog.com/) working on telematics software.  
Currently I don't have anything which I *should* make publicly available.  
  
However here is the framework I deployed to the Heroku cloud and then I built on top of this for several web apps:

#### Plotly Dash
**In 2018 I began using Dash by Plotly to productionalize my data analysis work.**  
  
I was introduced to this tool by a colleague and instantly realized how powerful Dash can be to implement my scripts into a resilient web-based dashboard.  These interactive charts can handle robust analysis and user interaction.  
I can make Dash apps available within a network or deployed to a web server like AWS.

#### Web Scraping
**I regularly use web scraping tools in various projects.**    
  
For real estate related work I have scraped listings of homes for sale, foreclosure lists, Zillow data, etc.  
When API integration is not easily (or cheaply) available I will use web scraping to get data from online sources.  Web scraping often requires using some basic methods to limit the frequency of hits to a given website or even some basic algorithms to simulate human online interaction with the website.  
<br>
      
#### Elasticsearch
**I use Elasticsearch to index large data sets with millions of records.** 
  
Then I will use Python scripting to build complex analysis on top of these data.  There are several packages which allow for relatively simple integration of Python analysis and Elasticsearch backends.  
<ul>  
 <li>For prototyping, I can setup my own local instance in either a Windows or Linux environment.</li>
 <li>For production, I typically hand off my work to a core engineering team to implement in a cloud environment like AWS or Google Cloud.</li>  
</ul>
Some examples of my models put into production using Elasticsearch backend:  
<ul>
 <li>Propensity score for online lead generation</li>  
 <li>Vehicle diagnostics (J1939/OBD) for school district transportation departments with over 15K vehicles</li>
</ul>
<br>
  
#### Reporting Database
**I take large structured or unstructured datasets and build reporting database systems.**  
  
To do this I create a Python application which interacts with a database backend usually in some flavor of SQL:
<ul>
 <li>SQLite</li>  
 <li>Postgres</li>  
 <li>MySQL</li>
</ul>
<br>
  
#### GUI in Python
**I use Tkinter and Kivy to build GUI applications in Python.**  
  
Typically these are lightweight programs which can be compiled into a standalone executable for deploying analysis scripts on a server.  
I have also used these packages to build utilities for automating tasks.   
<br>
  
#### Web Services/API
**I build simple RESTful web services using Python.**  
  
I have also learned to use Postman to integrate and document microservice or service oriented architecture in my applications.  
I can access available applications via API's to make use of external data in my own analysis.
