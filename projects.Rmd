#### Data Visualization Using Tableau  
**I use Tableau for data analysis and business intelligence.**
  
Here are some various Tableau projects from graduate school and internships:  
[Tableau Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.brewer#!/)
  
I have also participated in the implementation of Tableau Server.

#### R Shiny Applications  
**I use R Shiny to productionalize statistical data analysis written in R.**  
  
Here is an example of an R shiny app I built for an internship and deployed on shinyapps.io:  
[Online Lead Generation](https://davidalbertbrewer.shinyapps.io/Lead_Production_Dashboard/)  
  
This app is built on top of a data warehouse created from several disparate databases as well as marketing data feeds from various PPC ad partners like Google Adwords, Bing Ads, and Facebook.  The app provided a high level overview of lead production across all advertisers for ~15 real estate lead generation websites.  The dashboard provided enough information to make weelky decisions optimizing diversification of ad spend for ~$30K per month.  
  
Based on this work I was able to help by rigorously segmenting the advertising and feeding the results into a revenue optimization model.  This allowed prices to be dynamically changed based on factors like cost per lead, propensity score, expected value, supply/demand, and other factors.
