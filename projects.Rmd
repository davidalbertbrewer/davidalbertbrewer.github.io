*Data Visualization using Tableau*
[Tableau Dashboards](https://public.tableau.com/profile/david.brewer#!/)  
Here are some various Tableau projects from graduate school and internships  

*R Shiny Applications*
I use R Shiny to productionalize statistical data analysis written in R.  
[Online Lead Generation](https://davidalbertbrewer.shinyapps.io/Lead_Production_Dashboard/)  
This app is built on top of a data warehouse crated from several disparate databases as well as marketing feeds from various PPC ad partners like Google Adwords, Bing Ads, and Facebook.  
This provided a high level overview of lead production across all advertisers for ~15 real estate lead generation websites.  The dashboard provided enough information to make decisions about diversification of ad spend for about $30K per month.  
Based on this work I was able to help by rigorously segmenting the advertising and feeding the results into a revenue optimization model.  This allowed prices to be dynamically changed based on factors like cost per lead, propensity score, expected value, supply/demand, and other factors.
